1 - This is a personal project of Covid-19 Data Exploration Using SQL . Here I have used this data to analyse things like total cases , countries mostly affected by Covid -19 and much more.

2 - I have downloaded Covid-19 data from ourworldindata.org which had the data of people infected by covid-19 in specific countries during the period of January 2020 to April 2021.

3 - I have used SQL Queries in Microsoft SSMS to show the Covid-19 data like 'Total Cases vs total deaths and death percentage in India' ,'Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population','Continent With Highest Death Count' and many more.
